The objective of the PokemonTcgExcellConverter project is to enable Pokemon TCG collectors to search for cards and export them to an Excel file. Users can search for cards by name, artist, and set, and also input the number of cards they have.

Contributors are welcome to participate in the project by using the "dev" branch for development and submitting pull requests.
